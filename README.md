# Tipsy Nipper

The Tipsy Nipper Avions Fairey aircraft for FlightGear Flight Simulator.

This is a work in progress aircraft which doesn't fly actually. There's an
issue to start up the engine. But if you start from air, you can glide ... :-P

Somehow, over time, the jsbsim FDM doesn't work anymore. Need to find a volonteer which understand jsbsim.
